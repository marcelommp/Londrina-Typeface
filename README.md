Londrina is a typeface made from letters manually drawn on squared paper and then retraced on tracing paper. The starting point was to draw a generic sans serif vernacular-inspired type like the letters we see all the time in cafeterias and street commerce not only in Brazil. Londrina is now being distributed in 3 different packs, The Solid pack, The Layer pack and The SVG Color pack, as you can see in the images above. Originally Londrina was called Folk, but the name was already had registered by another foundry and as Londrina was join the Google Fonts catalog, we thought it was time for a new name, a tribute to the city where I lived. Since I started distributing this Font I have seen Londrina displayed in all sorts of professional and amateur projects, an instant hit and a great exemple of beginner's luck. This page to always make available the last updated version of the font files and also the source files for those who want to make their own version.
