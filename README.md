Londrina is a typeface created from letters manually drawn on squared paper and then finished on tracing paper. The idea was to draw a vernacular-inspired typography like the letters seen on cafeteria posters and popular commerce in Brazil. Londrina was divided into some styles, Solid being the filled version that for some time now has 4 weight variations. The Shadow and Outline versions are fonts of contour effects and can be used alone or overlaying the Solid version to create color composites using specialized software. Londrina isn't available as a ColorFont, YET, this is the next step after one more update of the character set. Originally Londrina was called Folk, but the name was already had registered by FontShop and as Londrina was join the Google Fonts catalog, we thought it was time for her to have a new name, a tribute to the city where I lived. Since I started distributing this Font in my old website I have seen Londrina displayed in all sorts of professional and amateur projects, an instant hit and also some beginner's luck. This page is to promote the Font and always make available the last updated version of the font files and also the source files for those who want to make their own version..
